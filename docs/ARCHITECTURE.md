### Design Principles

1. **Thread Safety**
   - All logging operations are protected by a mutex
   - Global state is managed safely
   - Thread-local buffers prevent contention

2. **Performance**
   - Buffered writing for efficient I/O
   - Optional async mode
   - Minimal allocations during logging

3. **Flexibility**
   - Builder pattern for easy configuration
   - Multiple output targets (console, file)
   - Extensible metadata system

4. **Reliability**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - File rotation to prevent disk filling
   - Resource cleanup on shutdown

5. **Usability**
   - Simple API for basic usage
   - Advanced features for complex needs
   - Clear error messages

### Core Logger Flow

1. **Initialization**
   ```
   User Request → Builder/Config → Global State → Logger Instance
   ```

2. **Logging Process**
   ```
   Log Call → Metadata Creation → Format Message → Buffer Write → Output
   ```

3. **File Rotation**
   ```
   Size Check → Rotate Files → Create New File → Resume Logging
   ```

### Memory Management

- Uses a provided allocator for all allocations
- Buffers are pre-allocated during initialization
- Resources are properly freed on shutdown
- No hidden allocations during normal operation

### Error Handling Strategy

- All errors are propagated to the caller
- Critical errors are logged if possible
- Fallback mechanisms for logging failures
- Clear error context for debugging

### Future Extensibility

The architecture supports future additions:
- Custom formatters
- Network logging
- Structured logging
- Log aggregation
- Pattern recognition
- Context tracking

### Performance Considerations

1. **Buffer Management**
   - Fixed-size buffers to prevent allocations
   - Buffer pooling for concurrent access
   - Configurable buffer sizes

2. **I/O Optimization**
   - Batched writes to disk
   - Asynchronous file operations
   - Memory-mapped files option

3. **Concurrency**
   - Lock-free operations where possible
   - Fine-grained locking
   - Thread-local storage
